<h3>Discord.js Command Handler</h3>
<p>This is a simple command handler for Discord bots using the discord.js library. It streamlines the process of setting up a bot, allowing you to run slash commands right out of the box with just a bot token.</p>

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Clone the repository.</li>
  <li>Replace the token in the code with your own bot token.</li>
  <li>The included sample command (ping.js) is ready to use. To add more commands, simply clone the ping.js file and customize the new command file.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! You're ready to start building your bot with ease.</p>
